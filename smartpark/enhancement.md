# SmartPark – Enhancements & Notes

##  Additional Enhancements

* **Authentication**: Added secure user registration and login (`/auth/*`) using JWT and password hashing (`jsonwebtoken`, `bcryptjs`). This protects all CRUD operations with proper authentication.
* **Reservations System**: Users can now book and cancel parking spots through `/reservations/*` endpoints—making the app more realistic and user-friendly.
* **Batch Upload**: Added a convenient `POST /parking/batch` endpoint for uploading multiple parking spots from CSV files using `papaparse`.
* **Real-Time Updates**: Integrated `socket.io` to send real-time notifications when parking spot availability changes, improving the user experience.
* **Enhanced ParkingSpot Model**: Expanded the `ParkingSpot` schema to include `pricePerHour` and `amenities` for more detailed listings.
* **Advanced Filtering**: The `GET /parking/nearby` endpoint now supports filters like `amenities` and `price`, helping users find exactly what they need.
* **Reservation History**: Added a `GET /parking/history/:id` endpoint to retrieve a user's reservation history.
* **Security Improvements**:

  * **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse with `express-rate-limit`.
  * **HTTP Headers**: Secures responses using `helmet`.
  * **Validation**: Ensures proper input through `joi`.
* **Logging & Monitoring**: Logs HTTP requests using `morgan`, and captures errors and info logs via `winston` for better debugging.
* **API Documentation**: Added Swagger UI at `/api-docs` (`swagger-ui-express`) to easily explore and test API endpoints.
* **Health Check**: Simple `GET /health` endpoint to check if the API is up and running.

##  Notes

* **Meets Requirements**: Fully covers the required RESTful API endpoints, `ParkingSpot` model, and geospatial queries using MongoDB’s `2dsphere` index.
* **Beyond Basics**: Includes helpful features like user accounts, real-time updates, and reservation history—making it feel like a real-world app.
* **Thoughtful Tech Stack**: Uses core libraries like `express` and `mongoose`, and enhances the experience with tools like `socket.io` for real-time, and `swagger-ui-express` for documentation.
